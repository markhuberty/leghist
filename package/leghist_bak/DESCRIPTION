Description: Given a final version of a document, decomposed into logical
    chunks, and a set of candidate origin documents for each chunk, leghist
    provides tools for both unsupervised and semi-supervised discovery of the
    best correspondence between the final document and its potential origins.
    These tools are designed to facilitate legislative history analysis but may
    be applicable elsewhere.
